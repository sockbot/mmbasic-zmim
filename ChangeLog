ChangeLog
---------

Version 3.6.2 - 8-Jul-2025:
 - Fixed crash when status line too long.

Version 3.6.1 - 16-Jun-2025:
 - Fixed "progress spinner" so that it is now enabled by default for WebMite.

Version 3.6.0 - 1-Jun-2025:
 - Added status line.
   - Having the status line "scroll" off the top of the display and then
     redrawing it (instead of having the text scroll beneath it) is a
     deliberate choice for performance reasons rather than a bug.
 - Added *FONT [SMALL | MEDIUM] meta-command.
   - KNOWN BUG: using *FONT SMALL on the Colour Maximite 2 causes the prompt
     to "glitch" in a way I have been unable to reproduce in a small example.
 - Added '--shell' command-line option which if used will cause Z-MIM to
   RUN the program specified in the "/.mmbasic-shell" file when it exits.
 - Changed code to use SELECT CASE rather than IF .. THEN .. ELSEIF ..
   constructs.
   - This should slightly improve performance.
 - Changed transpiled versions of Z-MIM to remove comments and unnecessary
   whitespace.
   - This should slightly improve performance.
 - Changed code to no longer use _ as a variable name as this was incompatible
   with the new PicoMite line-continuation feature.
 - Removed '--platform' command-line flag.
   - This was specifically for MMB4L and as of MMB4L v0.8 is no longer
     required due to enhancements to the RUN command.
 - Fixed *status meta-command to display time instead of score for
   "time games" such as "Deadline".
 - Fixed bug where cursor colour was always white rather than using the
   display foreground colour.
 - Fixed debug help text for displays <= 40 characters wide.
 - Fixed formatting of stored values when using interactive debugger.

Version 3.5.0 - 1-May-2025:
 - Added support for new platforms:
   - MMBasic for Linux.
   - MMBasic for Windows.
   - PicoMiteVGA and PicoMiteHDMI including USB versions.
   - PicoCalc (third party PicoMite variant).
   - Note that due to RAM limitations a "virtual memory" implementation is
     used when running on PicoMite RP2040 platforms making them slower.
 - Added command history to the prompt.
   - This is accessed via the Up & Down cursor keys.
   - Under the hood the console support has been replaced with the more
     advanced version that I developed for the "Scott Adams Adventure
     Interpreter" (SAAINT).
 - Added *MORE [ON | OFF] meta-command to enable/disable paged output.
 - Added *RECORD [ON | OFF] and *REPLAY [ON | OFF] meta-commands for recording
   and replaying scripts.
   - Script files recorded by previous versions are now invalid.
 - Added *SCREENSHOT meta-command for generating .bmp screen-shots.
   - Not currently supported when running from the MMBasic for Linux console.
 - Added *SPIN [ON | OFF] meta-command to enable/disable display of spinning
   cursor when Z-MIM is "thinking". The spinning cursor is enabled by default
   on PicoMite platforms.
 - Removed Colour Maximite 1 support; it was much too slow on the CMM1 to be
   playable and in any case that platform is now long superseded by the CMM2
   and PicoMite.

Release 3.1:
 - Fixed bug where "Integer array too small" array reported when restarting
   a story (Issue #21).
 - Minor performance improvement by using LGetByte() instead of Peek()
   to read Z-machine memory.

Release 3:
 - Optimised the CMM2 implementation at '/zmim/zmim.bas'; this is approximately
   15% faster than Release 2.
   - The unoptimised version, with readable source-code can still be found
     at '/zmim/src/main.bas' this is now slower than Release 2 because it
     uses an error checking memory implementation.
 - Added CMM1 implementation at '/zmim/zmim_cm1.bas'
   - currently, and probably forever, this is too slow to be playable but is
     included for completeness as the CMM1 was the original target for this
     project.
 - Fixed bug that could cause a story to be omitted in the story file chooser.
   - also ignore all story files beginning with full-stop, they are an artefact
     created by macOS.
 - Fixed missing variable declaration in interactive debugger.
 - Minor updates to the README.

Release 2:
 - Added word-wrapping
   - assumes 100 character wide console.
 - Added paging, i.e. displays [MORE] prompt when more than one page of text is
   output between input prompts
   - assumes 50 character high console.
 - Made execution approximately 15% faster.
 - Changed startup so that console is now cleared before the story file starts
   executing.
 - Changed console so that it only ever scrolls upwards and the input prompt is
   always at the bottom
   - this is the conventional behaviour for the console of a Z-machine
     implementation.
   - EXCEPTION: the initial selection of a story file and choosing whether to
     write a script.
 - Changed console so that it recognises when a story is trying to clear the
   console and reponds appropriately
   - the Z-machine provides no specific clear console instruction instruction
     so old z3 stories often just print 20-40 blank lines on the assumption that
     will be sufficient; as it probably was for a 1980s microcomputer.
 - Fixed issue with Z-MIM changing the current working directory
   - Z-MIM still changes it during operation but should now restore it before
     exiting either cleanly or due to an error or Ctrl-C.
 - Fixed "Error: EXEC is not declared" when quitting after a 'restart'.
 - Minor improvements to the interactive debugger.
 - Cosmetic improvements to code and README.

Release 1:
 - Initial public beta.
